## Introduction

This notebook is a companion to Afle et. al. (2023) posted at [arxiv:2304.04283](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04283.pdf). In the paper we investigate the ability of Cosmic Explorer to measure the physical propeties of core-collapse supernovae through its gravitational-wave radiation. In particular, we analyze the spectrogram of the signal to measure the properties of the f-mode oscillations of the protoneutron star.
